    <h2 class="blue center">About Me</h2>
    <p>Hello to anyone interested enough to read this profile. My name is Francis (Ryan) Rukab, currently a student at the University of North Florida. I was born and raised in Jacksonville Florida with both my brother and sister, the same city I ended up staying in for college. My brother (seen on the right in the image above) followed my path to UNF two years after me.</p>
    <p>Majoring in Information Technology, computers and all tech products have always peaked my interest. I am always the person in the family that will help you with your computer issues. Anytime someone has an issue, they will almost immediately come to me. I plan on graduating in summer of 2019.</p>

    <h2 class="red center">Hobbies and Interests</h2>
    <p>My most time-consuming hobby includes setting up and adjusting home automation products. I use open source software designed with the <a class="hover" target="target_blank" href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/">Raspberry Pi</a> based off Python called <a class="hover" target="target_blank" href="https://www.home-assistant.io/">Home Assistant</a>. Using the open source software allows me to use a wide variety of products together that would not normally be compatible. For example, I could turn on a Z-wave lightbulb if a RF Motion sensor detects motion during a certain time of day. </p>
    <p>Another major hobby of mine is watching sports. I am the biggest fan of both the Atlanta Braves and the Jacksonville Jaguars. Every Sunday you can find me watching a Jags game and during baseball season you can find my watching a Braves game.</p>
    <h2 class="purple center">Education</h2>
    <p>My education goals have almost been completed. My first and most important goal that I completed was graduating from Mandarin High School and receiving a High School Diploma. My next academic goal that I wanted to complete immediately after high school was to get accepted to a University. That goal was accomplished when I accepted UNFâ€™s offer to attend this school. My last goal is to graduate college with a degree in Information Technology. This goal should be completed by the end of summer 2019.</p>
